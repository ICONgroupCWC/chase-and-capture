# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Scalable Communication Network Challenges

This repository contains preliminary results for research into scalable and autonomous multi-agent systems to address challenges in communication networks. The project uses **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** to explore decentralized, adaptive control mechanisms for networks, enabling advanced orchestration, security, and real-time adaptability. The experiments documented here serve as an early demonstration of MARL’s potential in dynamic environments.

## Preliminary Results

Initial experiments demonstrate the adaptability of MARL agents in a grid-world environment, where agents collaborate to intercept targets with variable behaviors. These findings lay the groundwork for applying MARL to real-world network challenges, such as dynamic resource allocation and network slicing.

## Future Work

Building on these preliminary findings, future work will focus on scaling these techniques to handle more complex, realistic environments, integrating continuous action spaces, and optimizing agent communication protocols.
